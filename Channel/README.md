This directory was originally a part of another folder in my repository [Functional Programming Exercise](https://github.com/Blattvorhang/Functional-Programming-Exercises).

Here, we explore the principles of functional programming in the context of parallel programming.

In Homework 02 and 03, we delve into inter-thread communication using channels with the `Event` module.
